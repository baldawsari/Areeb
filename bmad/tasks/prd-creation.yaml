name: "prd-creation"
agent: "pm"
description: "Create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document from gathered requirements"
model_preference: "sonnet"

inputs:
  - "project-brief.md"
  - "requirements.md"
  - "market-analysis.md"

steps:
  - id: "review-inputs"
    action: "Review the project brief, requirements, and market analysis documents"
    output: "Input summary and gap analysis"
    details: >
      Thoroughly read all input documents. Identify any gaps, contradictions,
      or areas that need further clarification before the PRD can be written.

  - id: "define-scope"
    action: "Define the product scope, including in-scope and out-of-scope items"
    output: "Scope definition"
    details: >
      Clearly delineate what the product will and will not do in this version.
      Establish boundaries to prevent scope creep during development.

  - id: "write-user-stories"
    action: "Translate requirements into user stories with acceptance criteria"
    output: "User stories with acceptance criteria"
    details: >
      Write user stories in the format: As a [user type], I want [action]
      so that [benefit]. Each story must have testable acceptance criteria.

    action: "Prioritize features using MoSCoW method (Must, Should, Could, Won't)"
    output: "Prioritized feature list"
    details: >
      Assign each feature a priority level. Must-haves are required for launch.
      Should-haves are important but not critical. Could-haves are nice to have.
      Won't-haves are explicitly excluded from this version.

  - id: "specify-nfrs"
    action: "Document non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)"
    output: "Non-functional requirements specification"
    details: >
      Define measurable targets for performance (response times, throughput),
      security (authentication, authorization, data protection), scalability
      (concurrent users, data volume), and reliability (uptime, recovery).

  - id: "create-wireframes"
    action: "Create low-fidelity wireframes or UI flow descriptions"
    output: "UI flow descriptions"

  - "Success metrics are defined and measurable"
  - "Timeline and milestones are realistic"
  - "Risks and mitigations are documented"
  - "Dependencies on external systems are identified"
