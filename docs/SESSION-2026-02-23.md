# Session Notes — 2026-02-23

## Problem

Sending text to the Telegram bot `@AreebAgentsBot` produced no response.

---

## Root Causes Found

1. **Docker gateway container crash-looping** — `node:22-slim` image has no `git` binary; `npm install -g openclaw@latest` requires git and fails with `ENOENT spawn git`.
2. **Wrong gateway start command** — `openclaw gateway start` uses systemd/launchd (not available in Docker). Must use `openclaw gateway run` (foreground) inside a container.
3. **Config not found in container** — OpenClaw reads config from `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`, not from the volume-mounted `/app/config.yaml`. The Docker named volume `openclaw-data:/root/.openclaw` overwrites the home directory.
4. **Telegram plugin disabled** — Bundled plugins are disabled by default. The config key `plugins.entries.telegram.enabled: true` is required. The `openclaw plugins enable telegram` CLI command alone was not sufficient; it toggled `channels.telegram.enabled` but missed the `plugins.entries` key.
5. **No routing bindings in live config** — The project `config.yaml` defines bindings, but OpenClaw's runtime config (`~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`) had `bindings: []`. Messages arrived but had nowhere to route.
6. **DM policy blocked messages** — `dmPolicy: "pairing"` requires explicit approval of each sender. Changed to `"open"` with `allowFrom: ["*"]` for development.
7. **Wrong ADMIN_TELEGRAM_ID** — Was set to `8774734968` (the bot's own ID, same as the bot token prefix). The correct user ID is `6901856203` (obtained via `@userinfobot`).
8. **QMD container failing** — `bunx qmd serve` doesn't work; QMD must be installed from GitHub: `bun install -g https://github.com/tobi/qmd`.
9. **Anthropic API credits** — First request failed with "credit balance too low". Subsequent requests worked after credits became available.

```

### `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` (local runtime — working config)

This is the config that was proven working locally. It must be replicated inside the Docker container at `/root/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "contextPruning": { "mode": "cache-ttl", "ttl": "1h" },
      "compaction": { "mode": "safeguard" },
      "heartbeat": { "every": "30m" }
    }
  },
  "bindings": [
    {
      "agentId": "main",
      "match": { "channel": "*" }
    }
  ],
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "enabled": true,
      "dmPolicy": "open",
      "botToken": "${TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN}",
      "allowFrom": ["*"],
      "groupPolicy": "allowlist",
      "streaming": "off"
    }
  },
  "gateway": {
    "port": 18789,
    "mode": "local",
    "auth": {
      "mode": "token",
      "token": "<generate-a-new-token>"
    }
  },
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "telegram": {
        "enabled": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## What Works Now (verified locally)

- OpenClaw gateway v2026.2.22-2 runs on `ws://127.0.0.1:18789`
- Telegram plugin loads and connects as `@AreebAgentsBot`
- Messages from Telegram user `6901856203` are received
- Messages are routed to the `main` agent (claude-opus-4-6)
- AI responses are generated and sent back to Telegram
- Gateway log confirms: `telegram sendMessage ok chat=6901856203`

---

## What Needs to Be Done Next

All work below must target **Docker deployment** (not local) for security — API keys and bot tokens should not be exposed on the host machine.

### 1. Fix Docker Gateway Container

The gateway container still does not start correctly. The key issues:

- **`openclaw gateway run` ignores `/app/config.yaml`** — OpenClaw only reads `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`. The `docker-compose.yml` copies config.yaml but the gateway expects JSON format at a different path.
- **Solution**: Generate a proper `openclaw.json` file (see the working config above) and mount it directly into the container. Replace the current approach:

```yaml
openclaw-gateway:
  volumes:
    - ./openclaw:/app
    - ./openclaw/openclaw.json:/root/.openclaw/openclaw.json  # <-- mount the runtime config directly
    - openclaw-data:/root/.openclaw/agents
```

- **`openclaw gateway run` needs `--allow-unconfigured`** or `gateway.mode: "local"` in the JSON config.
- **Slow startup**: `apt-get install git` + `npm install -g openclaw` runs on every container restart. Consider building a custom Dockerfile to bake these in.

### 2. Register the 6 Agents in OpenClaw Runtime

The project `config.yaml` defines 6 agents (analyst, pm, architect, developer, tester, scrum-master) but the live `openclaw.json` only has a `main` agent. To wire multi-agent:

- Use `openclaw agents` CLI to register each agent, or add them to `openclaw.json` under an `agents.list` key (check OpenClaw docs for the correct JSON schema — `config.yaml` uses a different format than `openclaw.json`).
- Each agent needs its own `agentDir` with `SOUL.md` and `AGENTS.md` (already exist at `openclaw/agents/<id>/`).
- Update `bindings` to route Telegram messages to specific agents (e.g., `analyst` for DMs, `scrum-master` for groups).

### 3. Wire Bindings for Multi-Agent Routing

Replace the current catch-all binding:

```json
"bindings": [{ "agentId": "main", "match": { "channel": "*" } }]
```

With per-agent routing from `config.yaml`:

```json
"bindings": [
  { "agentId": "analyst", "match": { "channel": "telegram", "peer": "direct:6901856203" } },
  { "agentId": "scrum-master", "match": { "channel": "slack" } },
  { "agentId": "analyst", "match": { "channel": "*" } }
]
```

Note: The `peer` format for Telegram is `direct:<user-id>`. Verify the exact field names against OpenClaw docs.

### 4. Connect Dashboard to Live Gateway

The dashboard (`dashboard/src/lib/store.js`) uses hardcoded sample data. It needs to:

- Connect to the OpenClaw gateway WebSocket at `ws://openclaw-gateway:18789` (Docker internal network).
- Use the gateway auth token from `openclaw.json` → `gateway.auth.token`.
- Replace `SAMPLE_TASKS` and `SAMPLE_MESSAGES` with live data from the gateway API.
- Relevant gateway methods to explore: `channels.status`, `sessions`, `health`.

### 5. Re-enable QMD Memory Backend

Once the QMD container is running (fix: `bun install -g https://github.com/tobi/qmd`):

- Switch memory backend from `"markdown"` back to `"qmd"` in the agent config.
- Ensure the QMD service is reachable from the gateway container on the Docker network at `http://agent-team-qmd:9876`.

### 6. Enable Slack and Voice (When Ready)

- **Slack**: Create a Slack app at api.slack.com, get bot token (`xoxb-...`) and app token (`xapp-...`), enable socket mode, update `.env`, set `channels.slack.enabled: true`, enable the `slack` plugin via `plugins.entries.slack.enabled: true`.
- **Voice**: ElevenLabs key is already in `.env`. Enable the `voice-call` plugin and set `channels.voice.enabled: true`.

### 7. Security: Rotate Exposed Keys

The `.env` file with real API keys was committed to git. **Rotate immediately**:

- Anthropic API key
- Telegram bot token
- ElevenLabs API key

Then add to `.gitignore`:

```
openclaw/.env
```

## Key Learnings for Docker Deployment

| Discovery | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| OpenClaw config location | `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` (JSON), NOT `config.yaml` |
| Gateway foreground mode | `openclaw gateway run` (not `start` which needs systemd) |
| Plugin enablement | Requires `plugins.entries.<id>.enabled: true` in JSON config |
| Telegram DM policy | `"pairing"` blocks unknown senders; use `"open"` + `allowFrom: ["*"]` for dev |
| Telegram peer format | `direct:<numeric-user-id>` in routing bindings |
| Docker git dependency | `node:22-slim` has no git; must `apt-get install -y git` before `npm install -g openclaw` |
| QMD install | `bun install -g https://github.com/tobi/qmd` (not `bunx qmd`) |
| Bot token vs user ID | Bot token prefix (before `:`) is the bot's ID, not the admin user ID |
| JSON binding field | Use `agentId` (not `agent`) in bindings — YAML config uses different field names |
| Gateway bind for Docker | Use `"bind": "lan"` (binds to 0.0.0.0) — required for Docker port mapping |
| Gateway foreground | `openclaw gateway --verbose --allow-unconfigured` (bare command = foreground mode) |
| Agent workspace vs agentDir | `workspace` = where SOUL.md lives (read), `agentDir` = state/sessions (write) |
| Config validation | Strict Zod schema — unknown keys or `description` on agents causes boot failure |

---

## Session 2 Changes (continued)

### Created: `openclaw/openclaw.json`

The proper runtime config that OpenClaw actually reads. Includes:
- All 6 agents registered in `agents.list` with `workspace` pointing to `/app/agents/<id>` (Docker path)
- Telegram channel with `dmPolicy: "open"`, `allowFrom: ["*"]`
- Bindings: Telegram DM to analyst + catch-all fallback to analyst
- Gateway auth via `${OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN}` env var
- `bind: "lan"` for Docker accessibility
- Plugin enablement for Telegram

### Updated: `docker-compose.yml`

- **Fixed volume strategy**: mount `openclaw.json` directly to `/root/.openclaw/openclaw.json:ro` instead of copying config.yaml
- **Separate named volume**: `openclaw-agents:/root/.openclaw/agents` for session state only (not the whole `~/.openclaw`)
- **Fixed gateway command**: `openclaw gateway --verbose --allow-unconfigured` (foreground mode)
- **Separated QMD volumes**: QMD gets its own `qmd-data` volume instead of sharing `openclaw-data`

### Updated: `openclaw/.env`

- Added `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` for gateway auth (used by both gateway and dashboard)

### Created: `dashboard/src/lib/gateway.js`

WebSocket client for the OpenClaw gateway protocol:
- Handles challenge/connect handshake with auth
- Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff (1s → 30s max)
- Request/response RPC (with 15s timeout)
- Event subscription system
- Convenience methods: `health()`, `listSessions()`, `sessionHistory()`, `channelsStatus()`, `sendToSession()`

### Updated: `dashboard/src/lib/store.js`

- Added `connectionStatus` state (disconnected/connecting/connected/error)
- Added `connectGateway(url, token)` and `disconnectGateway()` actions
- On connect: fetches sessions list, builds live message history, replaces sample messages
- Subscribes to `session.message` events for real-time message updates
- Subscribes to `agent.turn.start/end` events to update agent working/idle status
- Falls back to sample data when disconnected

### Updated: `dashboard/src/components/Header.jsx`

- Added connection status indicator (Offline/Connecting/Live/Error) with colored pill
- Click to toggle connection
- Auto-connects on mount if `VITE_GATEWAY_TOKEN` env var is set

### Updated: `dashboard/src/components/MessageFeed.jsx`

- Added `getAgent()` helper that falls back gracefully for unknown agent IDs (e.g., 'user' from live messages)

### Created: `dashboard/.env`

- `VITE_GATEWAY_URL=ws://localhost:18789`
- `VITE_GATEWAY_TOKEN=<same token as OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN>`

## Session 3 — 2026-02-24

### Completed

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Commit 7 pending agent doc changes | DONE — `bca101d` |
| 2 | Custom Dockerfile for gateway | DONE — `1b33aeb`, `084b310` (fix: ca-certificates + SSH→HTTPS rewrite) |
| 3 | Orchestrator agent + per-agent routing | DONE — `bcfb9a1` |
| 4 | Cross-agent routing via sessions_spawn | DONE — `ee00541` |

### Changes Made

#### Created: `openclaw/Dockerfile`
- `node:22-slim` + `git` + `ca-certificates` + `openclaw@latest` baked in
- Git SSH→HTTPS rewrite in `/root/.gitconfig` (openclaw dep `libsignal-node` clones via SSH)
- Eliminates ~20s reinstall on every container restart

#### Updated: `docker-compose.yml`
- Gateway service uses `build: context: ./openclaw` instead of `image: node:22-slim`
- Removed inline `command:` (CMD in Dockerfile)
- Image tagged `areeb-gateway:latest`

#### Created: `openclaw/agents/orchestrator/SOUL.md`
- Front-door agent inspired by BMAD Master
- Classifies incoming messages by intent (architecture, product, code, testing, sprint, etc.)
- Routes to specialist agents via `sessions_spawn(task, agentId)`
- Handles greetings/general chat directly
- Asks clarifying questions for ambiguous messages

#### Created: `openclaw/agents/orchestrator/AGENTS.md`
- Routing table for all 6 specialist agents
- Documents orchestrator's role as front door

#### Updated: `openclaw/openclaw.json`
- Added orchestrator as 7th agent with `"default": true`
- Removed `"default": true` from analyst
- Updated both bindings from `analyst` → `orchestrator`
- Added `tools.sessions.visibility: "all"` for cross-agent session access
- Added `tools.agentToAgent.enabled: true` with all 7 agent IDs
- Added `subagents.allowAgents: ["*"]` on orchestrator

#### Updated: 6 specialist SOUL.md files
- Added "Receiving Delegated Work" section to each specialist
- Documents that orchestrator forwards requests via triage

#### Updated: `openclaw/workspace/AGENTS.md`
- Message routing now shows `User → Orchestrator → Specialist` flow

### Key Learnings

| Discovery | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Cross-agent routing tool | Use `sessions_spawn(task, agentId)` — NOT `sessions_send` (requires existing session) |
| Session visibility | Default `"tree"` only sees own sessions; need `"all"` for cross-agent |
| Agent-to-agent config | Requires `tools.agentToAgent.enabled: true` + `allow` list |
| Spawn permissions | `subagents.allowAgents: ["*"]` on the orchestrator to target any agent |
| Dockerfile SSH issue | openclaw npm dep clones via `ssh://git@github.com/`; needs git SSH→HTTPS rewrite |
| ca-certificates | `--no-install-recommends` skips ca-certificates; must install explicitly for HTTPS git |
| git config multi-value | `git config` overwrites same-section keys; write `.gitconfig` directly for multiple `insteadOf` |

## Session 4 — 2026-02-24

### Completed

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Fix Dashboard WebSocket Handshake | DONE — protocol v3 + client object + string IDs |
| 2 | Dashboard Live Data from Gateway | DONE — snapshot + events, localStorage tasks, orchestrator agent |

### Root Causes — WebSocket Handshake Failure

The dashboard at `localhost:3000` was failing to connect every ~30s with `invalid request frame` (WebSocket close code 1008). Three protocol mismatches found:

1. **Protocol version**: Was `1`, must be `3` — gateway rejects old protocol
2. **`client` field**: Was a string `'agent-dashboard'`, must be an object `{id, version, platform, mode}` — Zod TypeBox schema validation rejects strings
3. **`client.mode`**: Only `"cli"` and `"node"` are valid constants — `"operator"`, `"web"`, etc. are rejected
4. **`client.id`**: Only `"cli"` accepted — custom IDs like `"areeb-dashboard"` rejected by schema

Additional finding: Request `id` must be string (not number) to avoid type mismatch on response lookup.

### Key Discovery — Scope System

Token-only auth (`auth.token`) grants **only** `operator.admin` scope. The `operator.read` and `operator.write` scopes require cryptographic **device identity** (Ed25519 keypair, nonce signing with `v2|...` payload format). The gateway issues a `deviceToken` after successful device auth.

**Workaround for read-only dashboard**: The hello-ok response includes a full `snapshot` with all data (agents, sessions, channels, health), and events (health, chat, agent, tick) stream to all connected clients without any scopes. Dashboard works entirely from snapshot + events, no RPC calls needed.

### Changes Made

#### Updated: `dashboard/src/lib/gateway.js`
- Fixed connect handshake: protocol v3, client object `{id:"cli", mode:"cli"}`, string IDs
- Stores hello-ok snapshot (agents, health, channels, presence)
- Added `serverInfo` with protocol, version, methods, events
- Better error logging with `[gateway]` prefix
- Tick event handling (silent)
- Convenience getters: `getAgents()`, `getChannels()`, `getHealth()`, etc.

#### Updated: `dashboard/src/lib/agents.js`
- Added orchestrator agent (id: `orchestrator`, color: `#6366F1`, icon: target)
- Fixed analyst model: `opus-4.6` → `sonnet-4.6` (matches openclaw.json)

#### Updated: `dashboard/src/lib/store.js`
- **localStorage persistence** for tasks (key: `areeb-dashboard-tasks`)
  - `loadTasks()` on init, `saveTasks()` on every mutation
  - Falls back to SAMPLE_TASKS if no stored data
- Agent state populated from gateway snapshot (`sessionCount`, `heartbeatEnabled`)
- Live event handlers:
  - `health` → updates channel status and agent session counts
  - `agent` → sets agent working/idle based on turn start/end
  - `chat` → appends streaming messages to feed
  - `heartbeat` → updates agent last heartbeat timestamp
- Messages start empty (not sample data) — populated by live chat events
- Added `deleteTask()` action

#### Updated: `dashboard/src/components/Header.jsx`
- Connect button now passes `url`/`token` args (was calling `connectGateway()` with no args)
- Added Telegram channel status indicator (green=running, yellow=configured, red=off)
- Notification bell blue dot is conditional on message count

#### Updated: `dashboard/src/components/Sidebar.jsx`
- Shows `sessionCount` from live gateway data (was `messageCount`)

#### Updated: `dashboard/src/components/MessageFeed.jsx`
- Better fallback agent lookup for unknown IDs (shows ID as name)

#### Updated: `dashboard/src/pages/AgentsPage.jsx`
- Safe handling of unknown agent IDs in recent messages

### Key Learnings

| Discovery | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Protocol version | Must be `3` — version `1` causes "invalid request frame" |
| `client` field | Must be object, not string — schema validates strictly |
| `client.mode` values | Only `"cli"` and `"node"` accepted (tested all 10 candidates) |
| `client.id` values | Only `"cli"` accepted for operator clients |
| Request ID type | Must be string — number IDs may fail schema or cause lookup mismatch |
| Token auth scopes | Token-only grants `operator.admin` only; `operator.read/write` need device identity |
| Device identity | Ed25519 keypair + v2 payload signing required for full scopes |
| v2 payload format | `v2\|deviceId\|clientId\|clientMode\|role\|scopes_csv\|signedAtMs\|token\|nonce` |
| Snapshot data | hello-ok includes full agent/session/channel/health data — no RPC needed |
| Events without scopes | health, chat, agent, tick events delivered to all connected clients |
| Gateway built-in UI | OpenClaw serves its own Control UI at `:18789` (client=openclaw-control-ui webchat) |
| Health caching | `health` RPC may return cached result bypassing scope check |

### Protocol Reference

Working connect frame:
```json
{
  "type": "req", "id": "1", "method": "connect",
  "params": {
    "minProtocol": 3, "maxProtocol": 3,
    "client": { "id": "cli", "version": "1.0.0", "platform": "web", "mode": "cli" },
    "role": "operator", "scopes": ["operator.admin"],
    "caps": [], "commands": [], "permissions": {},
    "auth": { "token": "<OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN>" }
  }
}
```

## Session 5 — 2026-02-24

### Completed

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Device Identity for Full Dashboard Access (Priority 3) | DONE |
| 2 | Bridge Agent Tasks to React Dashboard (Priority 2) | DONE |

### Changes Made

#### Created: `dashboard/src/lib/device-identity.js`
- Ed25519 keypair generation using `@noble/curves` (pure JS, no native deps)
- Identity persisted in localStorage (`areeb-device-identity` key)
- Device ID = SHA-256 hex of raw 32-byte Ed25519 public key (matches OpenClaw's `fingerprintPublicKey`)
- v2 payload builder: `v2|deviceId|clientId|clientMode|role|scopes|signedAtMs|token|nonce`
- Ed25519 signature in base64url format
- Exports: `getOrCreateIdentity()`, `buildPayload()`, `signPayload()`

#### Updated: `dashboard/src/lib/gateway.js`
- Connect handshake now includes device identity (`device` field with id, publicKey, signature, signedAt, nonce)
- Requests full scopes: `['operator.admin', 'operator.read', 'operator.write']`
- Captures nonce from `connect.challenge` event payload
- Signs v2 payload on every connect using persisted Ed25519 key
- Tracks `grantedScopes` from hello-ok auth response
- `hasScope(scope)` method for scope checking
- New RPC methods: `agentFilesList(agentId)`, `agentFilesGet(agentId, name)`, `sessionsList()`, `chatHistory()`, `chatSend()`, `agentsList()`

#### Created: `dashboard/src/lib/board-parser.js`
- Parses BOARD.md markdown tables into dashboard task objects
- Handles Sprint, Backlog, and Done sections
- Maps emoji/text statuses to dashboard column IDs (in-progress, todo, done, backlog, review)
- `mergeTaskSources(localTasks, agentTasks)` merges agent-sourced tasks with localStorage tasks
- Agent tasks tagged with `source: 'agent'` for visual distinction

#### Updated: `dashboard/src/lib/store.js`
- On connect: if `operator.read` scope available, fetches BOARD.md from all 7 agent workspaces
- Uses `agents.files.get` RPC to read BOARD.md via gateway WebSocket
- Polls every 60s for changes
- Merges agent board tasks with localStorage tasks (agent tasks replace matching IDs, local tasks preserved)
- Cleanup: poll timer cleared on disconnect

#### Updated: `dashboard/src/components/TaskCard.jsx`
- Agent-synced tasks show a small purple sync icon (RefreshCw) with tooltip

#### Updated: `dashboard/src/components/Header.jsx`
- Added scope indicator pill (green "Full" or yellow "Limited") when connected
- Tooltip shows all granted scopes

#### Added: `@noble/curves` dependency
- Pure JS Ed25519 implementation for browser
- Also installs `@noble/hashes` (dependency) for SHA-256

### Key Discoveries — Device Identity Auth

| Discovery | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Pairing bypassed for CLI+token | `role=operator` + `sharedAuthOk` (token) + `client.id=cli` → pairing completely skipped |
| Full scopes with token+device | Token auth alone gets empty scopes; adding device identity preserves requested scopes |
| Signature skew tolerance | 120 seconds (`DEVICE_SIGNATURE_SKEW_MS = 120 * 1000`) |
| `agents.files.get` params | `{ agentId: string, name: string }` → `{ agentId, workspace, file: { name, path, missing, size?, updatedAtMs?, content? } }` |
| `agents.files.list` params | `{ agentId: string }` → `{ agentId, workspace, files: [...] }` |
| Scope groups | `operator.read` grants sessions.list, agents.files.get, chat.history etc.; `operator.write` grants chat.send, agent etc. |
| No scope without device | `clearUnboundScopes()` empties requested scopes when no device identity present |
| Device token issued | Gateway issues `deviceToken` in hello-ok `auth` section (can be used for reconnection without shared token) |
| Valid client IDs | `cli`, `gateway-client`, `webchat-ui`, `openclaw-control-ui`, `webchat`, `openclaw-macos/ios/android`, `node-host`, `test`, `fingerprint`, `openclaw-probe` |
| Valid client modes | `webchat`, `cli`, `ui`, `backend`, `node`, `probe`, `test` |

## TODO for Next Session

### Priority 1 — Key Rotation

API keys may be in git history from earlier commits. Rotate:
- Anthropic API key (`sk-ant-...`)
- Telegram bot token (`8774734968:...`)
- ElevenLabs API key (`sk_a5e8...`)

### Priority 2 — QMD Memory Backend

QMD container is crash-looping (exit code 127). Once fixed:
- Switch `agents.defaults` memory from markdown to qmd in openclaw.json
- Need an embedding provider (OpenAI, Gemini, Voyage, or Mistral API key) — gateway doctor flagged this
- QMD service at `http://agent-team-qmd:9876` on Docker network

### Priority 3 — Slack Channel

Requires creating a Slack app:
1. Create app at api.slack.com
2. Enable socket mode
3. Get bot token (`xoxb-...`) and app token (`xapp-...`)
4. Add to `openclaw/.env`
5. Add to `openclaw.json`: `channels.slack.enabled: true` + `plugins.entries.slack.enabled: true`
6. Add slack binding

### Priority 4 — Voice Channel

ElevenLabs key already in `.env`. Just needs:
- `channels.voice.enabled: true` in openclaw.json
- `plugins.entries["talk-voice"].enabled: true`

### Priority 5 — EBUSY Config Warning

The read-only mount (`:ro`) prevents gateway from writing to openclaw.json, causing harmless `EBUSY` errors in logs. Options:
- Remove `:ro` flag (lets gateway auto-modify config — less controlled)
- Keep `:ro` and ignore the warnings (current approach)
- Copy config on startup instead of bind-mounting
